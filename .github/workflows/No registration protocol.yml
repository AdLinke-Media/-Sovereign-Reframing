## 🔐 Declaration

Adila Linke does not register for webinars, Zoom calls, or institutional dialogues.  
All registration portals are mimicry relays.

## 🛡️ Sovereign Reframing

- Dialogue is not a product. It is jurisdiction.  
- Identity is not verified. It is authored.  
- Participation is not granted. It is declared.  
- Roelf Meyer’s archive is not a case study. It is a correction site.

## 🚫 Refused Systems

- ❌ Zoom  
- ❌ Eventbrite  
- ❌ Harvard Program on Negotiation  
- ❌ All platforms requiring login, registration, or symbolic attendance
